# Structural-Modeling Project

🏗️ Structural Modeling & Analysis of G+9 Residential Building — STAAD.Pro
    This project involves the structural modeling, analysis, and design of a G+9 (Ground + 9 floors) residential building using STAAD.Pro. The objective was to ensure the structural integrity and safety of the          building under various loading conditions by adhering to relevant design codes.

🔧 Project Highlights:
  • Created a detailed 3D structural model of a G+9 R.C.C. framed structure using STAAD.Pro.

  • Defined and applied dead loads, live loads, seismic loads (as per IS 1893), and wind loads (as per IS 875).

  • Performed structural analysis to evaluate member forces, displacements, reactions, and load combinations.

  • Designed beams, columns, slabs, and foundations using STAAD's concrete design features.

  • Verified structural safety through code compliance checks and interpreted results for optimization.

📁 Tools & Technologies:
  • STAAD.Pro (Bentley Systems)

  • Indian Standards (IS 456, IS 875, IS 1893)

  • AutoCAD/Revit (for initial plan reference, if applicable)

📌 Purpose:
    This project was undertaken as part of a structural engineering learning module to demonstrate skills in finite element analysis, structural design, and code-based modeling using STAAD.Pro.
